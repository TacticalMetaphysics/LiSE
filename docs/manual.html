<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Life sims all seem to have two problems in common:</p>
<section id="too-much-world-state">
<h2>Too much world state<a class="headerlink" href="#too-much-world-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The number of variables the game is tracking – just for game logic,
not graphics or physics or anything – is very large. Like how The
Sims tracks sims’ opinions of one another, their likes and dislikes
and so forth, even for the ones you never talk to and have shown no
interest in. If you streamline a life sim to where it doesn’t have
extraneous detail complexity you lose a huge part of what makes it
lifelike.</p>
<p>This causes trouble for developers when even <em>they</em> don’t really
understand why sims hate each other, and even if they do, failures of
bookkeeping can cause technical issues like how damn long it takes to
save or load your game in The Sims 3.</p>
<p>To address all those problems, LiSE provides a state container.
Everything that ever happens in a game gets recorded, so that you can
pick through the whole history and find out exactly when the butterfly
flapped its wings to cause the cyclone. All of that history gets saved
in a database, too, which is used in place of traditional save files.
This means that if your testers discover something strange and want
you to know about it, they can send you their database, and you’ll
know everything they did and everything that happened in their game.</p>
</section>
<section id="too-many-rules">
<h2>Too many rules<a class="headerlink" href="#too-many-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fans of life sims tend to appreciate complexity. Developers are best
served by reducing complexity as much as possible. So LiSE makes it
easy to compartmentalize complexity and choose what of it you want to
deal with and when.</p>
<p>It is a rules engine, an old concept from business software that lets
you determine what conditions cause what effects. Here, conditions are
Triggers and effects are Actions, and they’re both lists of Python
functions. Actions make some change to the state of the world, while
Triggers look at the world once-per-turn and return a Boolean to show
whether their Actions should happen.</p>
<p>The connection between Trigger and Action is arbitrary; you can mix
and match when you want. If you’re doing it in the graphical
interface, they look sort of like trading cards, so constructing a
rule is like deckbuilding.  Triggers and Actions exist independent of
the game world, and can therefore be moved from one game to another
without much fuss. I intend to include a fair number of them with the
release version of LiSE, so that you can throw together a toy sim
without really writing any code.</p>
</section>
<section id="architecture">
<h2>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>LiSE is a tool for constructing turn-based simulations following rules
in a directed graph-based world model. It has special affordances for
the kinds of things you might need to simulate in the life simulation
genre.</p>
<p>Rules are things the game should do in certain conditions. In LiSE,
the “things to do” are called Actions, and are functions that can run
arbitrary Python code. The conditions are divided into Triggers and
Prereqs, of which only Triggers are truly necessary: they are also
functions, but one of a rule’s Triggers must return True for the
Action to proceed.</p>
<p>A directed graph is made of nodes and edges. The nodes are points
without fixed locations–when drawing a graph, you may arrange the
nodes however you like, as long as the edges connect them the same
way. Edges in a directed graph connect one node to another node, but
not vice-versa, so you can have nodes A and B where A is connected to
B, but B is not connected to A. But you can have edges going in both
directions between A and B. They’re usually drawn as arrows.</p>
<p>In LiSE, edges are called Portals, and nodes may be Places or
Things. You can use these to represent whatever you want, but they
have special properties to make it easier to model physical space: in
particular, each Thing is located in exactly one node at a time
(usually a Place), and may be travelling through one of the Portals
leading out from there. Regardless, you can keep any data you like in
a Thing, Place, or Portal by treating it like a dictionary.</p>
<p>LiSE’s directed graphs are called Characters. Every time something
about a Character changes, LiSE remembers when it happened – that is,
which turn of the simulation. This allows the developer to look up the
state of the world at some point in the past.</p>
<p>When time moves forward in LiSE, it checks all its rules and allows
them to change the state of the world. Then, LiSE sets its clock to
the next turn, and is ready for time to move forward another
turn. LiSE remembers the entire history of the game, so that you can
travel back to previous turns and try things a different way.  This is
also convenient for debugging simulation rules.</p>
<p>LiSE can keep track of multiple timelines, called “branches,” which
can split off from one another. Branches normally don’t affect one
another, though it’s possible to write rules that change one branch
when they are run in another.</p>
</section>
<section id="ide">
<h2>IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The graphical interface, ELiDE, lets the developer change whatever
they want about the world. A game made with ELiDE will be more
restrictive about what the player is allowed to change, but all of the
player’s input will be turned into changes to the world, which the
rules may respond to however they need. Thus you never have to write
any input handling code to make a functional game in ELiDE.</p>
<p>ELiDE has three columns. On the right are a lot of buttons to access
the parts of ELiDE that aren’t visible right now, plus a couple of
icons that you can drag into the middle. In the middle, you have a
graphical display of the Character under consideration; dragging those
icons here will make a new Place or Thing. To connect Places with
Portals, press the button with the arrow on it, then drag from one
Place to another. Press the button again when you’re done. On the left
is the stat editor: it displays data that is stored in whatever entity
is presently selected. You can select Places, Things, and Portals by
clicking them–and once you’ve selected them, you can drag them
elsewhere. If no Place, Thing, or Portal is selected, then the
Character you are viewing is selected. There’s a button in the
top-right to view another Character.</p>
<p>On the bottom left are some bits to let you manipulate time, mainly
the Simulate and 1 Turn buttons. Simulate will start moving time
forward when you press it, and stop when you press it again.  There
are also text fields with which you can enter the time by hand.  Note
that rules are only run when you advance time using Simulate or 1
Turn.  The Tick field indicates how many changes have occurred in the
current turn.</p>
<p>It’s possible to view turns that haven’t been simulated yet.  This is
deliberate, but it’s not a good idea at the moment, because ELiDE
doesn’t know how to make plans yet.</p>
<section id="stat-editor">
<h3>Stat Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#stat-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This two-column table displays the keys and values in the selected
entity. By default, they are all shown as Readouts, which is to say,
plain text.</p>
<p>The “cfg” button at the bottom of the stat editor opens a window in
which you can add new stats and customize the appearance of the
existing ones. If you pick an appearance other than “Readout,” you
will be able to edit the stat when you’re not in this window.</p>
<p>“TextInput” is the most flexible appearance: you just type the value
that the stat should have. It will try to interpret your value as a
number, list, or dictionary if it can; by default, it will be taken as
a string.</p>
<p>“Toggle” is a button that, when pressed, changes the value from True
to False or vice versa. You can enter text to display instead of True
or False, but the actual value will still be True or False.</p>
<p>“Slider” is for numeric values that vary within a range. It needs a
minimum, a maximum, and a step size determining the smallest possible
change you can make with it.</p>
<p>You can use this to build a primitive interface to your game, or just
monitor the state of the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-editor">
<h3>Python Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#python-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Click the Python button to edit your game code in the IDE if you like.
In this case, you can’t use any of the decorators. Choose the
appropriate tab from Trigger, Prereq, or Action at the top, and the
function you write will show up in the appropriate part of the rules
editor.</p>
</section>
<section id="rules-editor">
<h3>Rules Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here you can assemble rules out of prewritten functions. First pick
which rule to edit from the menu on the left, using the box at the
bottom to add one if needed.  Then go through the trigger, prereq, and
action tabs, and drag the functions from the right pile to the left to
include them in the rule. You may also reorder them within the left
pile.</p>
<p>Rules made here will apply to the entity currently selected in the
main screen.  There is currently no graphical way to apply the same
rulebook to many entities.  You can, however, select nothing, in which
case you get the option to edit rulebooks that apply to the current
character overall,</p>
</section>
<section id="strings-editor">
<h3>Strings Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#strings-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The LiSE engine has an attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">string</span></code> that is accessed like a
dictionary and used to store arbitrary strings, such as might be shown
in a menu. You can edit those here. You can store strings for multiple
languages, and switch between them programmatically by setting
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">engine.string.language</span></code>.</p>
